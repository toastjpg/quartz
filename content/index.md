Hi üëã, I'm Johnny.

I'm a 4th-year [Computing Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) student at Simon Fraser University. 

Recently, I've been learning about [software testing](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~wsumner/teaching/473/24/) and [mobile app development](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2024/fall/cmpt/362/d100) with Android Kotlin.

In general, I enjoy learning about software development and the strategies for building software at scale.\
I also like to spend time exploring the outdoors, playing electric guitar, and going to the gym. 

On this site, you can find more about my:
- [Experience](about/experience.md) or summary of what I've done.
- [Projects](about/projects) that I've worked on. 
- [Posts](posts/) that dive deeper into the above two.

I also have a [Substack](https://toastjpg.substack.com/), where I occasionally write about various interests and hobbies.
