Hi, my name is Johnny.

I am a 4th year [Computing Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) student at Simon Fraser University. 

I enjoy learning cool things about software development, distributed systems, and system design. 

In my free time I like to explore the outdoors, play electric guitar, and doom scroll instagram reels (mostly this one). 

On this site, you can find:
- [Experience](about/experience.md) or summary of what I've done.
- [Projects](about/projects) that I've worked on. 
- [Posts](posts/) about semi-relevant topics.

I also have a [Substack](https://toastjpg.substack.com/), which holds a collection of random writings about whatever I find interesting.
