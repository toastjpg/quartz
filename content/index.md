Hi üëã, I'm Johnny.

![[image.jpg|500]]

I'm a 4th-year [Computer Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) student at Simon Fraser University. 

Currently, I'm a Software Engineer Co-op at [Planview](https://www.planview.com/), working on a product that [integrates software tools](https://www.planview.com/products-solutions/products/hub).

I enjoy learning about software development and the strategies for building software at scale. 
I've also enjoyed learning about 
[distributed systems](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2023/fall/cmpt/431/d100), 
[programming languages](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2023/summer/cmpt/383/d100), and 
[system security](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2024/summer/cmpt/403/d100) from past coursework.

Aside from that, I like to spend my time exploring the outdoors, playing electric guitar, and going to the gym. 

On this site, you can find more about my:
- [Experience](about/experience.md) or summary of what I've done.
- [Projects](about/projects) that I've worked on. 
- [Posts](posts/) that dive deeper into the above two.

I also have a [Substack](https://toastjpg.substack.com/), where I occasionally write about various interests and hobbies.
