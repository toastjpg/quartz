Hi, my name is Johnny.

I am a 4th year [Computing Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) student at Simon Fraser University. 

Currently, I'm learning about [Software Testing](https://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~wsumner/teaching/473/24/) and [Mobile App Development](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2024/fall/cmpt/362/d100) with Android Kotlin.

In general, I enjoy learning about software development, distributed systems, and system design. \
Outside of that, I like to spend my time exploring the outdoors, playing electric guitar, and going to the gym. 

On this site, you can find more about my:
- [Experience](about/experience.md) or summary of what I've done.
- [Projects](about/projects) that I've worked on. 
- [Posts](posts/) about semi-relevant topics.

I also have a [Substack](https://toastjpg.substack.com/), where I sometimes write about things that interest me.
