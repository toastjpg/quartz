Hi, my name is Johnny.

I am a 4th year [Computing Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) student at Simon Fraser University. 

I enjoy learning cool things about software development, distributed systems, and system design. 

I also like to spend my time exploring the outdoors, playing electric guitar, and doom scrolling reels (mostly this). 

On this site, you can find:
- [Experience](about/experience.md) or summary of what I've done.
- [Projects](about/projects) that I've worked on. 
- [Posts](posts/) about semi-relevant topics.

I also have a [Substack](https://toastjpg.substack.com/), where I sometimes write about things that interest me.
